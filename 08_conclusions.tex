\section{Conclusions}
We propose an inverse mapping method from motion data to a general character rig based on a spacetime optimization.
%Our method can be seamlessly applied to the current production pipeline.
As the rig space is a highly abstract user interface, the goal of our algorithm is to provide a robust mapping method without any prior information.
%The contributions of our method are two-fold: 
%The v a robust mapping method which does not require any manual sepcification or prior data.
In addition, we propose a new skeletal representation based on the Lie group 3D transformations of the rigid body, which helps achieve improved error minimization during the  optimization process.
%We prpose a new skeletal representation based on the Lie group 3D transformations of rigid body, which provides accurate error minimization during our optimization process.
We showed the stability and the generality of our method through various results.
Since our method can be seamlessly applied to the current production pipeline, it can increase the productivity of animation production remarkably.
